## 🧩 **Core Pillars of VERA**

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **1. AI-Powered App Generator** | Converts natural language prompts into full-stack app blueprints (UI + API + DB + logic + AI blocks) |
| **2. Full-Stack by Default** | Not just frontend like V0 or Lovable — VERA outputs backend, auth, database models, and AI routes |
| **3. Editable + Previewable Code** | Uses Monaco/Sandpack for live editing and preview inside the browser |
| **4. Built-in AI Plug-ins** | Users can connect their OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom model keys to inject features like summarization, chat, RAG, embeddings |
| **5. Secure Secret Handling** | Vault or UI to manage and inject API keys, database URLs, etc. per app session |
| **6. Export + Deploy Options** | Users can zip/export their full-stack codebase or deploy to platforms like Vercel or Render instantly |
| **7. Developer-Oriented UX** | Everything is inspectable, modifiable, and not a black box — code-first, not no-code |

## 🛠️ VERA Compared To:

| Platform | Limitation | How VERA Beats It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Replit AI Builder** | Great IDE, but poor for full app scaffolding + AI | VERA creates multi-file apps with auth, backend, and AI |
| **Lovable** | Beautiful UI generation, but no backend or test support | VERA adds DB, APIs, real-time testing, and AI scaffolds |
| **V0 (Vercel)** | UI-only, no full-stack or AI features | VERA outputs a fully runnable, smart app |
| **Other Code Generators** | Generate single-file apps, no backend or AI integrations | VERA adds backend logic, user auth, and plug-and-play AI features |

## 📊 **Technical Architecture**

| **Repo** | **Gives You** | **What You Need to Add** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vera-frontend` | Code UI, Monaco + Sandpack, prompt input flow | Replace codegen logic with modular backend + AI-aware templates |
| `smol-ai/developer` | GPT reasoning over app structure + files | Add Plop templates for fullstack app generation |
| `create-t3-app` | Auth, DB, routing, clean structure | Integrate with your generator or fork/automate setup |
| `vercel/ai` | Streaming UI hooks for prompts | Use in AI feature blocks: summarizer, chatbot, etc. |
| `plop.js` | Low-level file scaffolding engine | Connect to prompt pipeline, feed it schema + routes |
